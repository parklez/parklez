Hi, I'm parky! 🐼 /

I code professionally since 2020 (5 years) for a three letter company where I do several things - from planning integrations, coding, vulnerability patching, debugging, cluster deployment and configuration, database maintaining, application monitoring and analysis & onboarding and mentoring new members just to name a few.

I used to code way before I decided to work on this field, out of cheer fascination with the possibilities of creating my own software - I'm meticulous and take quality over quantity any day - I dislike slouch software as much as the end user.

This is my personal use account! - Check out my pinned projects below! 📌
